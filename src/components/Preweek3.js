                Programming has a way of humbling a person. I came into this programming with some programming
                skills knowing that they could be utilized but with every step came an new obstacle that required me to 
                find a new path to the answer.

                The biggest AHA moment was finally understanding how the big three work together and reference each other when 
                calling function, variable, or other objects that it needs. Once i've overcome learning how this works in full, 
                i believe that my progress with the three programs will really start taking off.

                The challenging item this time around was internalizing how css manipulate the boxes that the content is in.
                Margin, padding, and display were key items that i had trouble with and had to push through simply by utilizing 
                chrome dev tools to see how they function and change the content.
