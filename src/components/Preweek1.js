                The first week was excited, similar to the feeling you have right before you dive off a swimming
                pool
                diving board i was ready to commit
                head first. I had to install linux on my windows laptop to access the control line (terminal).
                Everything i tried would make my computer
                crash except for virtual box which is what i am using currently with linux version ubuntu 18.02 LTS.
            </p>

            <p> The next challenging part of the first week was learning how to utilize terminal commands with
                respect
                to repsitory's and directories
                located on github. This blog helped me further my understanding of how i can utilize these new
                aspects
                of web development. I was able
                to upload files from my local computer onto github which i am really proud of. Well that's the first
                week. I hope to keep learning and
                involving this blog to show you my continious improvement
            </p>
