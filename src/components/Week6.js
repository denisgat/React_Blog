                React at its core is structured nicely primary due to JSX. Given the ability
                to implement JS and HTML cohesivilly and then adding CSS through styles completes the package.
                The thing that's the trickiest about react is just implement dynamic rendering so 
                that your code is more efficient. At this time i am not yet skilled enough to implement
                the kind of efficient code i would like without thinking on it for sometime. 
                The final project i am thinking of is a web app that would make it easy for people to 
                track car modification and keep reciptes and dates of when the mod was done all in one place.
