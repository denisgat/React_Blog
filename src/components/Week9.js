                    My thoughts about laravel and React differ by the day. There are times when i see my self enjoing both, that is when i am able
                    to continuely implmement the neccessary features that the two programs offer but then there are times when the languages can be 
                    frustrating. This usually occurs when incooporating a new feature leads to more issues with other components. 
                    One thing i love about react is the multiple different ways you have to switch state particulary through react router. On the laravel side i particularly 
                    like the easy use of migrations/seeders/and factories to create your tables.
