                    PHP has been a learning experience that i will never forget. It opened up a field of understanding about web development that 
                    i had been yerning for for a while. I would like to learn about ? in php and how different paths associate with differnet coding instructions.
                    Learning php hasen't been exeptionally difficult however it has been difficult to find the time to learn everything while incooporating into the 
                    project we have to finish. If i had started with php instead of javascript i would probably be more intuative with how i was utilizing semi-colons as well
                    as paths. 
                </p>

                    I would like to use a SASS NPM package to utilize eventually, they would really help in styling the characteristics of my website making 
                    it much more appealing to visit and move around within the program.
