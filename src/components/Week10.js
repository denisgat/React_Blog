                    I believe the final project is instrucmental in seeing the growth that we've made over our period at the bookcamp.
                    As nerve racking as it is, it allows us to compound the things that we've learned so that they all come together for a 
                    unified project. 
                    I will struggle with overcoming my ability to see past what i already know. Instead of implementing old tech i should look at 
                    how what i have just learned or a new item that i would like to learn can be able to be implmented.

                    Agile methodology is a fantastic way to monitor growth and development. It does take up inital time during the project but 
                    will save you over the duration of the entire project by making you more efficient and thoughtful of the choices you are making during
                    developement of the final project. Large scale projects would be difficult if not impossible without agile methodology just simply due 
                    to the immense ammount of moving parts. I will always vouch for utilizing agile in any medium to large sized project.
