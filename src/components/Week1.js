                    This week the in person classes begin. Mixed feelings are felt but an overall excitement comes with the first day. 
                    I find that the in-person curicullum is much better since asking questions of other bootcampers and the instructors
                    is much easier. I struggled a bit to get things going initially but i was looking foward to the project that we were
                    to present.

                    Bootstrap opened the door for exciting UI features that would allow visually appealing websites to be created.
                    At first i could'nt grasp my head around it and hard to restart my project several times but by doing This
                    i learned a lot about how best to learn something new and how to integrate it more efficiently. The project 
                    I presented was Campain componenets and Mind Reader. Both of which i was pleased with.
