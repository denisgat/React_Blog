                    Now comes further implementation of what i have already learned. I enjoy this part as it allows you to continue learning but does not 
                    involve as many hoops. This time around we were to create a weather app utilizing a fetch API. This is something 
                    i've always known can be done but never knew how it works in the background. So lets make fetch happen. Visually my
                    project looked great as now i had a foothold on utilizing bootstrap. The next goal was to transition this
                    blog to Bootstrap which in my head i wanted to wait to do until i learned other creative features. I later found this 
                    to be detrimental and should have just accomplished the task at that moment.
