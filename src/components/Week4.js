                This week things started to get tricky again. State management is something critical
                to programming and is an important thing to learn; however, its by no means easy. I took 
                what i learned from previous times when i was in similar positions with new information and 
                did my best to learn efficiently.

                    The first project we were to create was a tic-tac-toe. One of the primary gaols of this project
                    was to utilize proper state management and play some code golf utilizing only JS. You had to be 
                    creative to do this which was in someways fun and in others frustrating. I was happy with how 
                    my project turned out and
