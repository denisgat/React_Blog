                    The final project is something that i am excited about but at the same time nervous. This is something 
                    all of the bootcampers have been looking forward to since it is the last thing we will be presenting. 
                    My current struggle is implementing new technologies into my final project since i have been running into blockers
                    which do not allow me the time to learn new features that i can add to make my project better. Instead i am spending my time
                    trouble shooting and solving my issues.

                    Its been a while since i've properly psuedocoded but i do always mentally coordinate the path i 
                    would like to take with my project. Currently my method for psuedo coding has transitioned from solely 
                    writing down what i would like to do with creating images, designs, and tables to essentially create 
                    my project before its initial start.
