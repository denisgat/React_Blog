                   This week was more continuel learing of HTML/CSS/JS with an emphasize of JS. 
                </p>

                <p> The next challenging part of the first was comprehending the logic and datatypes that javascript use to reach 
                    its goal. In essense learning to think like a computer. We had three projects we had to accomplish. The image gallary,
                    Digital clock, and Countdown Timer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout this program i've noticed that there comes a point when the assignments are giving you too much help. The image 
                    gallery was an example of this. It started with content already provided, but since my understanding of this content was limted
                    i was under the impression that what i was trying to do had no yet been done, leading to me spending hours overthinking things that 
                    were already done and coded. This has happened before but now i had finally understood the correct process to take when met with 
                    this kind of assignment. Firstly lead through the instructions thoroughly and multiple times, then try and relate the provided information
                    with what you already know and what you need to learn. Sadly i still had to resort to getting help in order to overcome this barrier but once 
                    through it was easy sailing.
        
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other two assignments were fairly similar to each other and mainly had to do with the logic side of JS and how JS talks to your
                    HTML file to display the items that you want. It was rather fun and this was a project that i was ready to present.
