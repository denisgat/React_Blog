                This week i learned how to use HTML. This <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started"
                    title="HTML learning" target="_blank"><em>website </em></a>
                was a great resource for me throughout my learning journey. A challenge i had was visualizing the code that i
                had creating in visual studio code
                since mamp (an html and code viewer) could not be downloaded on linux i had to find an alternative.
                Through the gracious help of a classmate
                i was able to use an extension on VSC to see live the webpage that i was creating. I am incredibly
                exicted about this as it gives me the capability
                to experiment to my hearts content.
